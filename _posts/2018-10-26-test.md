Bad Girl Good Health is a plant-based wellness for the girl who wants to look and feel amazing but makes no apologies for living her best life. Kymberly’s philosophy of plant-based s anything but mainstream. Her goal is to integrate cbd and cannabis as part of a healthy daily routine. Stereotypically, cannabis isn’t known to be used by the most productive or successful members of society, but Kym is blowing that bullshit out of the water. Working hard to break the stigma associated to cannabis consumption by providing basic relevant information on the amazing medicinal benefits of the plant. “Education is the key to unlocking the power of the plant. All we need to do is start the conversation.” Byrnes, who is a Brand Ambassador for Nugg MD, an online platform that allows for consumers to apply for a medical marijuana recommendation via their electronic devices.
