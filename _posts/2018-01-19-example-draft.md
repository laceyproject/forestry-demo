### **CannaBlis by Kym B** 

CBD infused eye cream

**Packaging** 

CannaBlis comes plain, simple and elegant as is. There is no fancy flashy box to discard. Kym tries to keep waste to a minimum, as a very earth conscious person. Everything you need to know about the product is clearly displayed on the product itself. Though the type is small, you can still clearly read every ingredient on the list. Personally, I find the golden cannabis leaf logo to be first sign that what is inside the jar is quality! 

 

**Ingredients** 

Every ingredient in this product was chosen not only for its high quality, but also for its natural and beneficial properties. All ingredients are ethically and responsibly selected. There are no unnecessary mystery fillers with questionable origins. Though a few of the ingredients may sound a little intimidating or scary, this product is chemical free. It's probably the most natural product in my arsenal, aside from my jar of raw organic coconut oil! But seriously, nothing I buy at Ulta is anything like this. 

 

**Color, smell, texture** 

The cream itself is white as snow. It is essentially odorless. I think it smells a little like paste, which brings me back to childhood and usually brings a smile to my face, but I'm a bit of a nostalgia addict these days. The cream is so soft and smooth. Some eye creams can have an oily or gloopy consistency and this is a thick paste like cream that seems to melt into your skin as you gently rub it under your eyes. A little goes a long way! I have had the same jar since June and I’ll probably have it until Christmas.  

 

 

**Application** 

The label says soothing and hydrating, but that is an understatement. When I met with Kym and she gave me the product to try, she said it is labeled an eye cream, but she personally uses it as a full-face cream. I tried it under my eyes first, as directed on the label, but that was short lived because it felt so good, I had to use it on my whole face! You can feel the cream melt as it penetrates your skin. It has an almost cooling effect, but not like the usual menthol cooling most skincare products have. The cream doesn’t leave an oily, greasy or heavy film on your face. If face makeup is your thing, you can easily apply it on top of the cream no problem.

**Overall** 

I love this product. Not to make any medical claims, but I get small cysts along my hair line and on my face. The doctor gives me a lotion to put on that dries out my face, its full of chemicals and I HATE using it, but I noticed that with regular use of this cream, I saw less cyst flareups on my face, than when I was lazy and used the cream less regularly. This is a product I would highly recommend to men and women alike, since it is odorless and leaves no residue on your face, you can wear it barefaced. It leaves a sense of rejuvenation that I haven't experienced with even the most expensive or top branded products I have tried in the past, and knowing that this product is crafted so thoughtfully and with such natural and high-quality ingredients makes me feel even that much more excited to tell my friends about it. It truly is CannaBliss... A blissful face experience!
