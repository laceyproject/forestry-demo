Navigating the New Jersey medical marijuana program is daunting to say the least. I spent years making phone calls and asking questions. I also spent years trying more traditional means of treating my various health conditions. Many people get angry when they learn I have a medical marijuana card in the state of New Jersey, because everyone thinks their ailment is more severe, but what they don’t realize is it took years to get where I am. I’ve tried over 30 different prescriptions, physical therapy, psychiatry, therapy, group therapy sessions, and even gone as far as meeting with an energy healer. 

 

My fibromyalgia diagnosis didn’t magically get my card. It doesn’t work like that. I had to wait for my condition to be on the list of treatable conditions. I was in near constant contact with my alternative treatment doctor. I had the burden of proving my illness to him and that I had exhausted all my traditional medical treatment options. I’ve spent so much time and money going from specialist to specialist and on different medications, vitamins and treatments. I have driven all over the state and been poked and prodded by every doctor I’ve seen. My health conditions didn’t just develop over night and I have suffered from most of them for as long as I can remember, but they didn’t always have a name… 

 

New Jersey isn’t as lenient as some of the states I have seen as far as what conditions are covered. As far as the states I am familiar with on the east coast, Maine seems to be where it’s at. New Jersey you have to be terminal or chronically ill, and even with that being said, you must have one of the following conditions: 

 

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lew Guerig’s Disease) 

Multiple sclerosis 

Terminal cancer 

Muscular dystrophy 

Inflammatory bowl disease 

Terminal illness with less than 12 months to live 

Now, if your illness isn’t on that list, don’t fret, there are more! The following are approved if you have tried traditional medicine and still not found relief. 

 

Seizure disorder 

Intractable skeletal muscular spasticity (This condition is why I have my card) 

Glaucoma 

Then the following conditions apply, if severe or chronic pain, severe nausea or vomiting, cachexia or wasting syndrome resulting from the condition or treatment of the following: 

 

HIV (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) 

Cancer 

 

If you have chronic pain or any other sort of chronic illness, your best bet is to find yourself a doctor that specializes in medical marijuana and make an appointment to sit and speak to them. Be prepared to be patient, these doctors in my experience tend not to be very quick at returning calls, and some of them have very disorganized staff. They will be helpful in assisting you through the ins and outs of the process. My doctor has several offices through out the state and he is the BEST at getting people approved. He knows what categories your illness falls under and if they are compassionate and really want to help you, they will. 

 

Expect to pay out of pocket though, most of these doctors do not accept insurance, so it will be your responsibility to do all the leg work and pay all the fees out of pocket. It will be very expensive. I think my first visit cost me almost $600, but my doctor’s office took care of all my paperwork which not all offices do. There is also a monthly or quarterly fee to keep your script open, similar to if you went to a psychiatrist. You need to be seen every three months, so try and find a doctor with an office that is easily accessible. 

 

As with anything else in life, your attitude when you go in will play a huge role in how things go for you. I find that many people I talk to about the program have attitudes that need to be adjusted. If you walk in demanding this or that, no one, not even a doctor, is going to take anything you say with any sort of compassion. Do your research for the state you live in. If you live in New Jersey, a doctor isn’t going to care about what you read happens in California. Every state is different. The laws very from state to state and no doctor wants to be told how to do their job. When you meet with your doctor, you should call ahead and ask what documentation you need. I needed to bring all my medical files with me. I happen to have mine already because I had gone to court for my disability hearing. My records are about as thick as a phone book and my failed medications was several pages long. The more information you can bring with you at the time you meet with your doctor, the better.

There is no such thing as too much medical information. If you are in and out of the hospital, keep those discharge papers or go to records and request them, they are just as valuable as your records from your primary or any of your specialists. KEEP EVERYTHING you get from any medical professional. A medical marijuana doctor wants you to be well, but their goal is to get you taking as few prescriptions as possible. I was able to get off all the medications I was taking, but that isn’t typical for everyone, so don’t fret. 

 

If you don’t have a qualifying condition as of yet, don’t lose heart, my friends. Medical marijuana is ever evolving. If you want to treat my health conditions with MMJ, then advocate. Don’t sit back and wait for it to happen, get out there and make it happen. Keep up to date on the laws as they change, and sign the petitions, go to the rallies and write your local government and reach out to the communities around you to see how you can get more involved. If all else fails, research other medical states and if moving is an option for you, look into what states laws may benefit you and your medical needs!
