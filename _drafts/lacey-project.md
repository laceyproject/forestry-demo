The “LaceyProject” started a few years ago and hasn’t come into full effect, yet.  

 

The “ LaceyProject “ is my journey finding my place in this world, while I learn to cope with chronic pain. On my Instagram by the same name, I’ve been sharing my journey with cannabis as a means of controlling my chronic pain, and I document my “Stoney” adventures. Truth is, the LaceyProject is more than just that. There is much more to my life than smoking cannabis, and it seems that my health is trying to control my life more and more with each day, and with that being said, I want to get going on sharing my journey while I can.  

 

I feel like to better understand myself, I’d like to know how others see me. They say that we never truly see ourselves as we really are, even what we see in the mirror is only a reflection of what we perceive of ourselves. 

 

I have always enjoyed writing. I’ve played with the idea of blogging for a long time. I’ve had several blogs, but they all fizzled out. I didn’t know what I was doing, nor was I taking my writing seriously. I started countless stories and posted them piece by piece and left them unfinished… Now, I’m taking a serious, hands on approach. I’ve enrolled in writing classes, I’ve bought books on blogging, writing, social media marketing, etc. 

 

😁 Fun fact: in high school I took art classes so I could write short stories and poetry, because I went to vocational so I wasn’t able to take any writing classes with my schedule.  

 

So now you’re probably wondering what any of this has to do with you. 

 

What I’m asking of you is this; tell, me honestly the person you see characteristically, not physically. What do you perceive as my strengths, weaknesses, passions, qualities and personality. What topics do you enjoy talking to me about? What kind of matters would you come to me with for advice? What kind of content on my Instagram do you enjoy seeing (the food, the nature adventures, the crazy faces, serious posts, funny posts, etc)  If you’ve read my writing, what have you read? What topics do you enjoy reading that I’ve written? (Poetry, stories, my blogs, my published pieces) 

 

This is all very early in its infancy. I, honestly, had no idea the amount of effort that went into blogging for a profession. It’s probably going to be fall before I have my blog fully up and running, but I think this is going to be a helpful tool in helping me discover who I am, uncovering my strengths, determining my weaknesses and getting a full idea of the way people perceive me as a means of personal growth towards the person I strive to be. I may ask for further input as I move forward in this process.  

 

I appreciate your time and honesty.
